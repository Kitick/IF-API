Ensure:
- You have the Infinite Flight Connect setting checked on.
- Both devices are connected to the same network.

IF YOU WANT TO USE AN EXE FILE
- Open the /executables folder and find your system exe.
- Open it and click download. If your system gives you crap about running an unsigned exe you can run it anyway.
- Unless you don't trust me, then don't. You can also look at the code yourself if you wish. OR run it with node directly.

IF YOU WANT TO RUN USING NODE
- Dowload node.js: https://nodejs.org/en | You do not need to install anything else but Node itself.
- Download the code by clicking the green CODE button, and download zip.
- Extract the folder to wherever you like. If you are updating, delete the old folder first.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Double click your exe OR run "node index.js" in your terminal in the folder you extracted.
- You should see a message saying it is ready.

Open your browser and go to localhost:8080. Or double click localhost.
- You should see it say connected.

If you know the IP address of your device, enter it. If you don't, just click connect.
- You need to use private addresses, i.e. the ones starting with 192.168. Public addresses do not distinguish individual devices.
- It will autofill 192.168 if you only enter the last two digits and also add .1. if you only put the very last.

Once it says it's ready and the options appear, Enjoy.

Feel free to report any issues here on github or dm them to me on discord at Kitick#5380.
